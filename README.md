# schouten-calculus
An implementation of the Schouten algebra of multi-vector fields over the ring of sympy symbols.

To Do:
* Hamiltonian Vector Field
* Poisson Algebra Class (?)
* Differential for Poisson (Co)-Homology  (may be useful -- use sympy / M2 to solve resulting equations.)
* Contraction / inner product
* Curl Operator! (easy!)
* Canonical examples (Volume Form, std Poisson str, sl2, etc...)
